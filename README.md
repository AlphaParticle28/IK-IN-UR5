# MODERN ROBOTICS PROJECTS
This repository consists of all the projects that I have done ni the 'Modern Robotics' course offered by Coursera and North Western University.
Each project file consists of the main code, simulation screenshots and/or videos carried out in CoppeliaSim, output text and followed by a .csv file which is fed into CoppeliaSim to carry out simulations.
