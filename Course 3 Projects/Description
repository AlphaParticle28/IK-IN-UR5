Similar to what was done in the course 2 project, the problem statement of the project in course 3 was provided with:
1] Configuration matrices of each link along with the orientation of the end effector
2] Spatial inertial matrix of each link
3] Screw axis matrix

The task being to simulate the behaviour of the manipulator when subjected to free fall with different initial 
configurations of the manipulator utilizing the `modern_robotics` library in python following the forward dynamics model.

In the end, a .csv file should also be produced, which consists a list of joint angle configurations at every iteration.
