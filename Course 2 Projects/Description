The project required me to write a python code for determining the possibility of the existence of an inverse kinematic(IK) solution for a given initial configuration of the robotic manipulator using the Newton-Rhapson method to determine the final error term in the configuration, which tests positive for IK, if it lies below a certain upper limit. 

The code was then saved as a '.csv' file which was later called in a custom-made scene in CoppeliaSim simulator, which displayed the simulation of the UR5 manipulator adhering to the given transformation conditions within 5 iterations.
