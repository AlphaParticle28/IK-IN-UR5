As a part of my recent course project of modern robotics specialization offered by Coursera I had to apply concepts revolving around forward kinematics into the simulation of inverse kinematics, which involved writing the python code for displaying the feasibility of inverse kinematics for a given configuration of UR5 manipulator.

In a nutshell, the project required me to write a python code for determining the possibility of the existence of an inverse kinematic(IK) solution for a given initial configuration of the robotic manipulator using the Newton-Rhapson method to determine the final error term in the configuration, which tests positive for IK, if it lies below a certain upper limit.

The code was then saved as a '.csv' file which was later called in a custom-made scene in CoppeliaSim simulator, which displayed the simulation of the UR5 manipulator adhering to the given transformation conditions within 5 iterations.

In order to make sure my algorithm is consistent with the theory, here are a few snippets from the book "Modern Robotics: Mechanics, Planning, and Control" by the course instructors Prof.Kevin Lynch and Prof.Frank Park.
